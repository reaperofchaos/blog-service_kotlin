This is a SpringBoot application built using kotlin. This is taken from the [Spring.io kotlin tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/).
The code has been updated to make use of a more logical package structure and is using Data Transfer Objects and services
to interact with the REST controllers.
